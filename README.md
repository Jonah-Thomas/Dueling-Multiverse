## Overview

Dueling Multiverse is a web application for building, saving, and dueling with custom Yu-Gi-Oh! decks. Users can create and manage decks, chat with other duelists, and (soon) challenge each other in real-time duels. The app uses Firebase for authentication and data storage, and features a modern, responsive UI.
